## Overview

This challenge was very rewarding. I expanded on a lot of things I learnt before-hand and even incorportated new tools to finish the design and match it neatly.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Complete the challenge with just HTML and CSS

## My process

I took the mobile-first approach to solving the problem, I combined flex-box and grid to complete the overall layout and used a bit of javascript for the toggle functionality.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt and applied the use of NODE_LIST DOM elements and iterated the list to apply different display modes on the card prices.

### Continued development

There is always something to improve, maybe adding a theme-changer built into the design would be a great addition.

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71243168/how-to-change-content-with-toggle-button-with-html-css-and-js) - StackOverflow was of big help in implementing the toggle functionality as they led me in the right direction.

StackOverflow came to the rescue when I was finding it different to design the toggle component, saved me an extra day of troubleshooting.
